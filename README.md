This task was implemented using core Java tools and a modern development platform to demonstrate how a Java application can consume a public REST API and display data in a structured format. The primary tool used in this task is the Java programming language, which is responsible for handling user input, building the API request, processing the response, and displaying the output. Java was chosen because it is platform-independent, widely used in industry, and well suited for client–server and web-based applications. The program was written using standard Java packages, ensuring simplicity and compliance with internship guidelines that often restrict the use of external libraries.

A key tool used in this task is the Java HTTP Client API provided by the java.net.http package, which is available from Java 11 onwards. The HttpClient class was used to create an HTTP client, the HttpRequest class was used to build a GET request, and the HttpResponse class was used to receive the response from the server. These classes together enabled smooth communication between the Java application (client) and the public weather service (server). This demonstrates real-world REST API consumption, which is an important skill for backend and full-stack development.

The task also makes use of a public REST API, specifically the Open-Meteo Weather API. This API provides real-time weather information such as temperature, wind speed, and time based on latitude and longitude values. Since the API is free and does not require an API key, it is ideal for learning and academic projects. The API response is returned in JSON format, which is commonly used in modern web services.

To make the application interactive, the Scanner class from the java.util package was used. This allows the user to enter latitude and longitude values at runtime instead of using hardcoded data. Runtime input improves flexibility and helps demonstrate how real applications work with user-provided data. The JSON response received from the API was parsed manually using basic string operations such as split(). Although professional applications use libraries like Gson or Jackson, manual parsing was intentionally used here to rely only on core Java tools, as required in many internship tasks.

The entire task was developed and executed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the development platform. VS Code was chosen because it is lightweight, fast, and provides excellent support for Java through the Java Extension Pack. This platform offers features such as code suggestions, error detection, debugging, and an integrated terminal for compiling and running Java programs. The task is applicable in academic projects, Java lab exercises, internships such as CODTECH, and beginner-level industry applications. It demonstrates essential concepts like REST API usage, HTTP communication, JSON handling, and structured output, making it highly relevant for students and entry-level developers.
